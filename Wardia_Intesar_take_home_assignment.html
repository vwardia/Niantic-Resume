            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <ul class="objective"
            <li>
                As a Technical Artist at The BRICC Foundry, I pioneered a project where interns got to explore VR, game development, and 3D modeling. Demonstrating leadership, I acquired proficiency in C# and visual scripting, taking the initiative to structure and code gaming funtions in Unity when there was no available intern for programming functions.
                I am keen to contribute to Niantic's mission of enriching reality through AR experiences. I am to leverage my skills in 3D, creative design and problem solving, to collaborate with a team of like minded individuals and push the boundaries of AR/VR technology.
